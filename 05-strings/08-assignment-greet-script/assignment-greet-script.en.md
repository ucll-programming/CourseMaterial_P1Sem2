# Greet Script

### `TASK`

Turn the previous greet exercise into a runnable script.

- Create a file `greet.py`.
- Copy all relevant code from your previous solution.
- Add a `main` function.
- Call the `main` function at the top level, but only if the file is ran as a script.
- Add a shebang line at the top to inform the OS about how to launch this file.
- Launch the file and check that everything works as intended.
